# Hi, I'm Ankit Deopurkar 👋

I am a Master's student in Information Systems at Northeastern University (Boston, MA) with 4+ years of professional experience in Data Engineering and Cloud Infrastructure.

I specialize in building scalable real-time and batch data pipelines, optimizing cloud-based data platforms, and applying GenAI patterns like RAG and agentic workflows to accelerate analytics automation. Previously, I engineered streaming ingestion and analytics pipelines at Plymouth Rock Assurance and built production-grade ETL systems processing 100GB+ daily at KPMG India.

## 🚀 What I've Built

- **Agentic RAG Pipeline**: An AI-powered retrieval-augmented generation system using Apache Airflow to automate data ingestion, processing, and intelligent Q&A retrieval from financial documents.

- **Financial Multimodal RAG**: A multimodal RAG application for financial document analysis, enabling intelligent querying across text, tables, and visual elements in financial reports.

- **Data Extract & Standardization**: An automated pipeline for extracting and standardizing structured and semi-structured data sources, improving data quality and downstream reporting readiness.

- **LLM Integration**: End-to-end LLM-powered workflows integrating large language models into data processing and analytics pipelines for enrichment and anomaly detection.

- **Hackathon Projects**: Rapid prototyping of AI/ML solutions including intelligent document processing and data-driven analytics applications.

## ⚡ Tools & Technologies

- **Languages**: Python, SQL, Java, C++, C
- **Streaming & Distributed**: Apache Kafka, Spark, Flink, PySpark
- **Cloud & DevOps**: AWS (S3, EMR, Lambda, Glue, CloudWatch), Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform
- **Data Warehouse & Databases**: Snowflake, Trino, MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle Cloud
- **ETL / Orchestration**: Apache Airflow, Batch ETL/ELT, Real-time Ingestion, Data Quality & Schema Validation
- **GenAI / ML**: RAG, LLM Analytics, Agentic Workflows, Anomaly Detection
